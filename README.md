# week 1 - C\#

## bash

- cd = change directory
- mkdir = make directory
- pwd = print working directory, . current position, .. parent directory
- ls = list resources, -a --all all resources, -l all information
- touch = create a resource/file
- cat = read/display content of resource/file
- code = launch VS Code
- ssh-keygen =  generate ssh key, public and private keys, secure shell
- nano = command line editor
- sudo = root permission
- apt = advanced package tool, update check for updates, install install package, upgrade apply updates
- wget = download web resource

## dotnet

### commands

- dotnet new = create new resource (project, gitignore, solution), console(exe), classlib(dll), sln,  gitignore, xunit(test)
- dotnet build = code compilation
- dotnet test = run unit tests
- dotnet run = execute code, runtime [invoke dotnet build in the background]
- dotnet add = add package/reference to project
- dotnet sln = add add project to solution, remove remove project from solution

### platform

- compiler = conversion/translation tool, type checker, permission checker, high-level language to low-level language
- assembly = compiled code in intermediate language
- CLI, CIL, MSIL = Common Language Infastructure, Common Intermediate Language, Microsoft Intermediate Language
- CLR, BCL, CTS, VES, JIT = Common Language Runtime, Base Class Library, Common Type System, Virtual Execution System, Just In Time Compiler
- languages = C#, F#, VB.NET, JavaScript, Python, Java*

## git

- git init = create a .git directory to track changes (Distributed Version Control System)
- git add = select resources to track, git add README.md LICENSE, git add .
- git commit = save changes to .git directory with reference
- git log = list/display all recent commits
- git push = share .git directory with other nodes (remote/local nodes), -u --set-upstream
- git status = list/display current state of version history, including saved/unsaved changes
- git remote = setup/name connection to remote node

## oop

Object-Oriented Programming is defined as a structure of objects that contain their own state and behavior

- abstraction = exposing a set functionalities where specification is left to implementation
- encapsulation = controlling access to object data and/or functionality, given object is complete, data hiding
- inheritance = grouping functionality/data into a common structure/entity to reduce redundancy
- polymorphism = ability to change based on functionality but not on reference

## class

- field, backing field
- property
- constructor
- method
- destructor
